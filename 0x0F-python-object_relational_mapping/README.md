# Python - Object-relational mapping

- 0. Get all states

  - script that lists all states from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa

- 1. Filter states

  - script that lists all states with a name starting with N (upper N) from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa

- 2. Filter states by user input

  - script that takes in an argument and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument.

- 3. SQL Injection...

  - script that takes in arguments and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument. But this time, write one that is safe from MySQL injections!
